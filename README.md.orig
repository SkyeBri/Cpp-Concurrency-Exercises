# C++ Concurrency Exercises

The objective of this repo is to provide coding exercises and room to play with concurrency.
In each exercise branch there will be a coding problem, possibly some quiz questions. The solution
branch would then obviously contain a solution (not to say that it is the best or only solution, but A solution)...

For ease of viewing, I might recommend cloning into two repos (an exercise repo and a solution repo) to view side by side as needed...but that's just me. You may have a better way of dealing with that. :)
